# BART-Psych-Experiment
A psychology experiment that assesses risk-taking by popping balloons

1)The user is shown a "deflated balloon" and 3 counters - Current Balloon, Pumps, Points

2)The user clicks on the "Pump The Balloon" button to pump the balloon up. The user can keep clicking it until it bursts.

3)The user can save the pumps and move to the next balloon whenever he wants. This ensures that the user actually gets the points from 
pumping the balloon. 

4)If the balloon bursts before the user saves, the user gets zero points and the trial goes onto the next round.
